**Spellcasting** 
Eith is a lvl 2 WIzard and casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12, spells to hit +4)

Cantrips: Ray of frost, Gust, Absorb Elements, Shocking Grasp
First level: Thunderwave, Grease, Fog Cloud
Second level: Enlarge/Reduce

_**Talos' Caring Hand.**_ When the weather wizard casts a spell, he can immediately fly up to 10 ft. away, landing on solid ground.

---
**Actions**
**Dagger** *Melee or ranged weapon attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1 d4 + 2) piercing damage.*

**Shocking Grasp** *Melee or ranged weapon attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1 d4 + 2) piercing damage.
The weather wizard can combine _absorb elements_ with shocking grasp for a very powerful melee attack, dealing 1d8 lightning damage plus 1d6 of another type of damage, enough to potentially knock out a 1st-level character completely in one shot. If you feel that this is too powerful, you can instead combine it with his unarmed strike, dealing only 1d6 + 1 damage instead.

**Lair Actions**
- _**Wind!**_ Each character on the platform must make a DC 12 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they are pushed away from the Weather Wizard all the way to the edge of the airship's deck, where they smack their backs against the railing. They don't fall, but they definitely shouldn't look down. On a successful save, they stand their ground.
- _**Rain!**_ Each character on the platform must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, they take 1 cold damage and fall prone. Remind them that they must spend half their movement to stand back up. On a successful save, they take no damage and they don't fall.
- _**Divine Fury!**_ Each character shields their eyes from a flash of light from the lightning rod and must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they become frightened of the Weather Wizard, meaning that they can't willingly move closer to him and their attack rolls are made at disadvantage. On a successful save, they are not afraid.

Once the weather wizard is defeated, the storm subsides.

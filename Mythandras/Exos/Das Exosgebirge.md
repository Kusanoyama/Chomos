Es gibt den Hauptberg und 6 Berge in perfekter Symmetrie um den Hauptberg herum, die 6 Heralde.

Wer den Hauptberg erklimmt bekommt den innersten Wunsch eines Wesens erfüllt und hat die Chance für eine Zeit in den Himmel aufzusteigen und einen Aspekt der Naturgesetze anzunehmen.

Um das Tor im Hauptberg zu erklimmen muss man jedoch vorher die 6 Heralde erklommen haben. Nur dann öffnet sich das Tor im Hauptberg.

## Die 6 Exosberge um das Exosgebirge:

1. Unten rechts, Si'ris:
   Archangel Mirael: He inhabits the mountain of fire and tests mortals on their courage and bravery. He carries a sword and represents the ideal of strength.
2. Oben Links:
   Archangel Gariel: He inhabits the mountain of ice and tests mortals on their perseverance and determination. He carries a mace and represents the ideal of endurance.
3. Unten Links:
   Archangel Raael: He inhabits the mountain of wind and tests mortals on their agility and speed. He carries a bow and represents the ideal of swiftness.
4. Oben rechts:
   Archangel Urael: He inhabits the mountain of earth and tests mortals on their wisdom and intelligence. He carries a staff and represents the ideal of knowledge.
5. Unten Mitte 
   Archangel Sariel: He inhabits the mountain of water and tests mortals on their adaptability and flexibility. He carries a trident and represents the ideal of fluidity.
6. Oben Mitte
   Archangel Azrael: He inhabits the mountain of darkness and tests mortals on their fear and how they face their fears. He carries a scythe and represents the ideal of acceptance.

The final test on the main mountain is facing a champion of Exos in battle carrying a spear, to prove that the mortal has mastered the ideals represented by all the archangels and is worthy of ascending to the heavens.
